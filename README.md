# MBA611 – Data Analytics with R and Stan  
**Author:** Mia Cardenas  

Welcome to my slightly terrifying but exciting adventure into the world of data analytics.  
This repository is where I’ll keep all my code, notes, models, and random “aha!” (and “uh-oh…”) moments from the MBA 611 course at Manhattan University.

## 💻 Setup Status  
Everything is installed and miraculously working (for now):  
- 🧠 **R** and **RStudio**  
- 🧩 Packages: `rmarkdown`, `tinytex`, `rstan`, `rethinking`, `brms`, `ggplot2`  
- 🔗 GitHub synced  
- 📚 Following *Stats Two* on Leanpub and *R Cookbook, 2nd Edition*  

If something breaks, I’ll blame Stan first.

## 📊 Focus Areas  
- Making sense of data without crying  
- Building Bayesian models that (hopefully) converge  
- Telling data stories with **ggplot2**  
- Pretending I understand Markov chains before coffee kicks in

## 🧠 Fun Fact  
I love analyzing data — from my students’ grades to how many cups of coffee it takes to finish a model run.  
Numbers never lie… but they do like to confuse me on purpose.
