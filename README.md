# MBA611 – Data Analytics with R and Stan  
**Author:** Mia Cardenas  

This is my workspace for the MBA 611 Data Analytics course at Manhattan University.  
Here I’ll be exploring data, building models, and trying to make sense of the world one R script at a time.

## Setup  
Everything’s ready to go:  
- R and RStudio installed  
- Packages: `rmarkdown`, `tinytex`, `rstan`, `rethinking`, `brms`, `ggplot2`  
- GitHub connected  
- Books: *Stats Two* (Leanpub) and *R Cookbook, 2nd Edition*  

Let’s just say a few hours of setup and minor panic were involved, but we made it.

## What I’ll Be Doing  
- Learning Bayesian thinking without losing mine  
- Building and visualizing models with R  
- Using ggplot2 to tell stories through data  
- Keeping everything organized (or trying to)

## About Me  
I’m originally from Acapulco and work at Manhattan University. I’ve been living in New York for four years, and I love analyzing data — honestly, I do it for everything in my life, personal or professional.

*Still slightly terrified, but excited to see where this data adventure goes.*
